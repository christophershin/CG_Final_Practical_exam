The two additional shaders I added: 

- Toon:
  for toon shader I added it to the background so that there aren't any high fidelity light or shadows in the scene since this is a 2D game. I added a toon shader from https://learn.ontariotechu.ca/courses/34225/pages/toon-shader?module_item_id=802766 and then changed the base color to a dark blue and the Rim color to black to make it look like a dark background.
